This project is a visually interactive 3D puzzle animation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design splits an image into multiple 3D cubes, and upon interaction, these cubes align into the full image with a smooth animation. It demonstrates creative use of 3D transformations, CSS styling, and JavaScript interactivity.

Features
1. 3D Transformation: Each piece of the image is displayed as a separate 3D box.
2. Smooth Animation: On clicking the "Magic" button, the boxes rearrange into a seamless full image.
3. Dynamic Layout: The project adapts the image into a grid-based layout with depth effects.

Technologies Used
1. HTML: To structure the layout and define the grid of boxes.
2. CSS: For styling, including 3D transformations, box shadows, and animations.
3. JavaScript: To handle click events and toggle the animation state.

How It Works
1. Image Segmentation: The image is divided into smaller parts using CSS grid.
2. 3D Effect: Each grid item is styled as a 3D box with depth and shadow.
3. Animation Trigger: The "Magic" button triggers a JavaScript function that manipulates CSS classes to animate the boxes into their respective positions.

Usage
Clone or download the repository.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Click the "Magic" button to see the animation in action.
